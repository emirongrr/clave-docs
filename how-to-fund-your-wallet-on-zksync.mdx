***Depositing Funds from Cex’s:***

Currently, several centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Binance, OKX, and Bybit, support deposits to Clave. To deposit from these CEXs, they must support zkSync withdrawals.

1. First you need to **select the withdraw button,** then you’ll see the withdraw screen.

3. You’re ready to deposit funds to Clave.

We know that these deposit flows are not best, currently working on direct on-ramp solutions to provide a better and seamless deposit experience.
