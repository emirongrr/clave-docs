## DEX Pools

A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Pool is a liquidity pool where users can provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges in return for earning a portion of the trading fees and other rewards. These pools play a crucial role in the functioning of DEXs by ensuring there is sufficient liquidity for trading activities. 

In the Earn Section, you can see syncswap pools which are DEX pool.

## One-Sided Staking (e.g., ZK)

One-sided staking allows users to stake a single type of asset rather than providing pairs of tokens. This method is simpler and less risky as it doesn't expose users to impermanent loss. 

We have build a ZK staking contract and enabled single sided ZK staking. 

## Lending Pools

Lending pools in blockchains operate like digital banks, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries. In these systems, individuals with extra cryptocurrency can contribute their tokens to a pool, creating a collective fund. Borrowers can then access this pool, but they must provide collateral to secure their loans, ensuring the safety of the lenders' funds. Lenders earn interest from their contributions, which comes from the fees paid by borrowers. This setup allows people to lend or borrow cryptocurrency easily and safely, all without needing a traditional financial institution.

We've enabled multiple lending pools in our Earn hub for yield opportunities.
