# How to Send Money via Clave

## **Send**

By clicking “Send” on the home screen, you can send crypto to anyone seamlessly in three ways;

**a) Send to Clave Username**

This is the most conventional way to send crypto to others. If the person you are sending crypto to already has a Clave account, you can simply write their username and send it. In Clave world, you can search for the username you wish to send crypto if you don’t remember the username.

If the recipient does not use Clave, you can write their ENS and wallet address or scan the QR and send it.

> An extra step might be to convince them to use Clave, and then everything would be much easier for everyone.

**b) Send with a link**

Everyone loves surprises and treasure chests, so you can simply create a magic link for others to claim when sending crypto to someone. The best part is that you don’t even need to know the address or username of the recipient; Clave does its magic to carry the process, thanks to our partner, [Peanut Protocol](https://peanut.to/?ref=blog2.getclave.io)!

You can select which crypto you want to send, enter the amount, and swipe to confirm. Voila, your magic link is ready to make people happy. You can see your unclaimed links at Hub->Links.

## **Request**

By clicking “Request” on the home screen, you can request crypto from other Clave users either via link or QR code.

Now, you can share your link or QR code with others.
