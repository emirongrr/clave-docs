### How it works?

An Externally Owned Account (EOA) is created in the background for your wallet and synchronized to your `iCloud Keychain` on Apple and `Google Drive` on Android devices, after being encrypted with the password you set.
This EOA acts like your Guardian and can start a recovery process for your account
