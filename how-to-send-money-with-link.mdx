*Baki does not need to know Ulas' address to send money!*

Payment links let you send money via any messaging platform (like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram) without needing the recipient's address. This method eliminates the need to know the recipient's account information, and the best part is that the recipient doesn't even need to have a Clave account beforehand, made possible by the infrastructure of the [Peanut Protocol](https://twitter.com/PeanutProtocol?ref=blog2.getclave.io).

Just send the link, and the recipient can claim the funds with a few simple steps.

### **Payment links offer the flexibility to send money to literally ANYONE!**

You can choose the cryptocurrency you'd like to send, enter the amount, and swipe to confirm.

Voilà! Your magic link is ready to make someone's day. You can also find your unclaimed links in the Hub under "Links."
