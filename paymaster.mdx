title: Paymaster
description: "This section gives information about using ERC20 tokens as Paymasters in Clave Wallet."

One of the most important features of Account Abstraction is Paymaster, which allows you paying the gas fees with
any ERC20 token that you want. This feature is available in Clave Wallet, and you are able to use `USDC` and `DAI` tokens to pay the gas fees.

We also implemented sponsored transactions in Clave Wallet, which allows you to send transactions without paying any money. However, this is currently
not in use, and we can utilize it for specific events in the future.
