You can easily trade any crypto to another with just a few clicks while you have full custody of your funds. You can buy ETH, BTC, and many others with USDC, USDT, DAI, or any token on ZKsync Era. While trading, you will not see any network fee, so you can *free*ly discover the edges of DeFi.

For now, we are using [Odos Protocol](https://app.odos.xyz/?ref=blog2.getclave.io), one of the best aggregators in the ecosystem, to give you the best quote and route to get you the best price possible. We will add more options in the future.
