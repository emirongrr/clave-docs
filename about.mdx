    <Accordion title="What is Account Abstraction?">
      Account Abstraction is an improvement on Ethereum that enables smart contracts to be used as a wallet, bringing many different new features such as batch transactions, sponsored transactions, and paymaster. We have a comprehensive guide for Account Abstraction written by our researcher if you would like to learn more about it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is Passkey?">
      Passkeys are built on the WebAuthentication (or "WebAuthn") standard, which uses public key cryptography. During account registration, the operating system creates a unique cryptographic key pair to associate with an account for the app or website. These keys are generated by the device securely and uniquely for every account.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How secure is Clave?">
      Our contracts have been audited by sector pioneers and you can find the report here. Our codes are also open source. You can always check them yourself.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I don’t see my seed phrases/private key, how can I see them?">
      Clave utilizes Account Abstraction and passkeys; thus, you don’t need to remember seed phrases. Your seed phrase is encrypted in the secure enclave of your device. Clave takes advantage of Passkeys to interact with the secure enclave to sign transactions. This allows users to engage with contracts smoothly.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Without seed phrases, how will I access my Clave account if I lose my phone?">
      There are two ways to recover your account. If you have multiple devices and your passkeys are synced with those devices, then you can access your Clave account on a new phone when you log in to your Apple or Google accounts.

      Another way to recover is via social recovery and you can always assign your friends, family members, and other wallets you use. When you lose your phone, they can assist in recovering your account. For details, check here.

  <Accordion title="App Specific Questions">
    <Accordion title="Can I import an existing wallet to Clave?">
      Unfortunately, no. Since Clave is a smart contract wallet, it is not possible to import an existing wallet.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I accidentally sent my tokens to the wrong network, is it possible to recover?">
      No, Clave only works on ZKsync's Era Mainnet. Funds sent from other networks cannot be recovered, so always double-check before depositing.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How can I deposit into my Clave account?">
      To make deposits into your Clave account more straightforward, we partnered with Layerswap. In the “Hub” menu of the app, enter “Deposit,” then choose from which network you want to fund your account and send the fund to the Deposit Address shown on the last page. Thanks to the collaboration between Clave and Layerswap, funding your wallet is this easy.

      For more information about deposits, you can check our blog.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I need a username and can I use my username on other wallets?">
      Your username is attached to your wallet address on Clave, so you don’t have to write a long address. Right now, you can only send using the username on Clave, but in the future, you will be able to use your Clave username as an ENS subdomain in every wallet.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I sent crypto to my Clave account but I can’t see them, where are they?">
      If the token you have sent is not one of the default tokens on Clave, you can manually add a custom token to your portfolio page. Go to My Portfolio, click Add Token and Add Manually, then enter the token’s contract address. Now you can see it on your balance. For more detailed information, you can check our guides here.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How will I recover my wallet if I lose access to my phone/wallet?">
      Clave uses two different methods of backup; one is Passkey and the other is Social Recovery.

      Passkey allows users to recover their wallets via iCloud or Google.

      Social Recovery makes it possible for users to add guardians and recover their wallets through them. Guardians might be your friends & family or another EOA wallet you have. We highly recommend adding at least one guardian to your account in case of losing your phone.

      For more details about the Backup and Recovery process, you can read our tutorial.
