Clave implements a social recovery method that allows users to recover their accounts by using their friends' help.
You are able to add any wallet on zkSync (Clave account, Address, or ENS) as your `guardian`, who are available to recovery account in specific `timelock`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many guardians can I add?">
    You are able to add infinite number of guardians on Smart Contract level. However, we limit guardian count to `3` in Clave Wallet user interface to not make the process complex and less secure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remove the guardians after adding them?">
    `Yes`, you are able to remove guardians whenever you want, except your recovery is on process. You can stop the recovery process to remove the guardians.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many guardian approvals do I need to recover my account?">
    In Clave Wallet, one confirmation is enough to recover your account. However, you are able to set the `threshold` value in Smart Contract level to adjust the number of approvals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my guardians act suspicious?">
    Guardians are expected to be the people you trust. `You will receive email when the recovery process of your account starts`.
    If your guardians act suspicious and try recovering your account without your information, you can cancel the recovery process and remove the guardian.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long should I wait to execute my recovery?">
    The default `timelock` value in Clave Wallet is `48 hours`. We are planning to make it adjustable in the future, since this feature is available in the Smart Contract.
