After connecting your Clave wallet to a dApp using Wallet Connect, you can easily make transactions directly from your browser. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Initiate the transaction** in the dApp on your browser (e.g., a swap on SyncSwap).
2. A **confirmation screen** will appear in your browser, indicating the transaction details and prompting you to sign in your wallet.
3. Open the Clave app, where you will see a **Signature Request** from the dApp you connected to.
4. **Review the transaction details** in the Clave app to ensure everything is correct.
5. **Use Face ID or fingerprint** to sign in and approve the transaction.
6. **Swipe to proceed** and complate biometric authentication.
