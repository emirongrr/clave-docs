1. **Open the Clave app** and navigate to your profile.
2. **Click on "Social Backup"** to view and manage your guardians.
3. **Swipe Left on the guardian** you wish to remove.
4. **Click the trash icon** next to the guardian's name.
5. **Confirm the removal** by clicking "I understand, remove anyway."

By following these steps, you can ensure the security of your Clave account and prevent any unauthorized recovery attempts. If you have any concerns, you can always update your guardians for added security.
