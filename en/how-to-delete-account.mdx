### Collected Data

1. **Account Information** Your public wallet address, email (optional) and username (optional), photo
   (optional). Other users can view your profile, including your photo, within the app, fostering a more
   interactive community. If you prefer to maintain complete privacy, we recommend not providing
   optional information such as your username or photo.

2. **Device Information** Such as the type and version of the device,, certain device settings like
   language, time, time zone, and Internet Protocol (IP) address.

3. **Usage Information** Information about activity on the digital content viewed, features accessed, such
   as visited pages, searches, or links clicked.

4. **Push Token** We rely on the push notification systems of your device, such as iOS and Android, to
   send you notifications related to your wallet activities and security. These push tokens (device
   tokens) do not carry any personal information but are used solely to direct notifications to devices
   that have our wallet software installed. This ensures that important information about your wallet is
   securely and directly delivered to your device.
   Anyone who wishes to completely avoid the processing of push token data can disable push
   notifications for the app in the Settings section of their device. Therefore, we are unable to process
   your push token identity that is generated based on your device information.

5. **Transaction Information** The information contains data about the type of transaction, amount,
   assets, and other transaction metadata.
   We may collect your information from other sources, including:

   ● **Publicly available Blockchain Data** We collect publicly available blockchain data, including details
   of transactions, assets held in your wallet, and other relevant information. This is essential to
   accurately reflect the activity in your wallet and ensure the security of your operations within the
   blockchain network. This data helps us maintain the integrity and reliability of our app by providing
   real-time, accurate information directly to your device.

6. **AD_ID and Android_ID** We collect unique device identifiers to track certain ad performances of Clave Wallet and prevent certain sybil attack factors for our campaigns.

### Deletion and Data Removal Process

Upon account deletion, Clave Smart Wallet will securely delete all associated user data within 6 years after the end of service, ensuring full compliance with data retention policies. If a user submits a request for data removal, all data will be permanently erased from our systems within one year of the request. This process ensures that user privacy is respected while adhering to legal and regulatory requirements.
