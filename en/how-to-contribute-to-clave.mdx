Clave uses Mintlify to create documentation. To contribute to Clave, you should start by installing Mintlify first.

<Warning> Prerequisite: 
Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 19 or higher before proceeding. </Warning>


Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

### Install Mintlify

`
npm i -g mintlify
`

### Modifying an Existing Translation
If you want to modify (fixing typos, enhancing the wording etc.) an existing translation

1. **Fork the Project**  
   Make a fork of the [clave-docs project](https://github.com/getclave/clave-docs) and create your branches from the default main branch.  
   If your PR is still a work in progress, consider putting it into a Draft status. Once your PR is ready for review, switch it back to an active PR request, and any reviewers already attached will automatically get a notification.
2. And start modifyingg the texts in the MDX files. Please follow PR Rules to Open a PR. 

### Adding a New Language

1. **Fork the Project**  
   Make a fork of the [clave-docs project](https://github.com/getclave/clave-docs) and create your branches from the default main branch.  
   If your PR is still a work in progress, consider putting it into a Draft status. Once your PR is ready for review, switch it back to an active PR request, and any reviewers already attached will automatically get a notification.

2. **Create a File Named with Your Language**  
   (You can use the short form of the language name, for example, we used TR for Turkish) 

 
3. **Add Your Language to the JSON File**  
   Simply copy the code below and change `yourlanguage` to your language.

> To configure all repetitions of a word (e.g., `yourlanguage`) on the same page in VSCode, follow these steps: **Select the `yourlanguage` Word**:  Then, use the key combination `Ctrl + Shift + L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + L` (Mac) to select all occurrences of `yourlanguage` on the page. This allows you to edit them all at once. This way, you can edit all selected words simultaneously. 



Copy the code below and change it to your language

Add the short name of your language to the `versions` array to enable indexing for your translations.

5. **Open Your Language's File and Start Translating.**
   If your PR is still a work in progress, consider putting it into a Draft status. Once your PR is ready for review, switch it back to an active PR request, and any reviewers already attached will automatically get a notification.
