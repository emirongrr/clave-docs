Clave is a smart contract-based, mobile-first wallet (a.k.a. Smart Wallet) that operates on ZKsync and leverages ZKsync’s native account abstraction and hardware elements to provide the best user experience with the best security available on modern devices. 

Clave consists of three parts: 

1) User Device, Clave Application 

2) Clave Backend 

3) Onchain part - Smart Contracts. 

### 1) Clave Application and User Device

Clave is a mobile wallet that can be downloaded to Android and iOS devices. Clave utilizes Webauthn standard (passkeys) and provides hardware-level security. Webauthn is a new authentication method designed to eliminate the need for passwords and utilizes public key cryptography. Clave is one of the first teams to implement Passkeys into Smart Accounts. You can find more information in the passkeys section: 

### 2) Clave Gateway (Backend)

Clave has a backend that indexes blockchain data and shows users to best up to data from onchain. It also listens to users’ transactions and shows users the transaction status. It is designed to have no latency (submilliseconds) and serve seamless UX for the users. 

 

### 3) Onchain Smart Contracts

Clave accounts are self-custodial and smart contract based, which means they are fully programmable and modular. Clave Smart Contracts are controlled by the users and secure the funds. Clave Contracts are open-sourced and you can find more information [on our github:](https://github.com/getclave/clave-contracts)
