*Baki does not need to know Ulas' address to send money!*

Payment links let you send money via any messaging platform (like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram) without needing the recipient's address. This method eliminates the need to know the recipient's account information, and the best part is that the recipient doesn't even need to have a Clave account beforehand, made possible by the infrastructure of the [Peanut Protocol](https://twitter.com/PeanutProtocol?ref=blog2.getclave.io).

To create a payment link, you should follow these steps: 

1. **Open the Clave app** and navigate to the home screen.
2. **Click on "Send"** to begin the process of sending money.
3. **Choose "Send with Link"** from the available options.
4. **Enter the amount** of cryptocurrency you wish to send. You can select the type of cryptocurrency from the list provided.
6. **Confirm the details** and swipe and complete biometric authentication to proceed.
7. **Your payment link is now ready.** You can share this link via any messaging platform, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram.
