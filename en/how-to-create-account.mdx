Creating an account with Clave is simple and secure. By using passkeys instead of traditional private keys and seed phrases, Clave provides an easy onboarding process with the highest security standards. Follow our step-by-step guide to set up your new Clave account and start managing your cryptocurrencies with ease.

Clave is a smart wallet that uses passkeys rather than private keys and seed phrases. These technologies are supported by [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195?ref=blog2.getclave.io) and [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/13548313?hl=en&ref=blog2.getclave.io), so Clave uses highly secure encryption techniques to provide users with the highest security and easiest way to control their funds. Thanks to these new improvements, you don’t have to worry about complicated private keys or seed phrases and you can turn your phone into a hardware wallet!

Now, head to the App Store or Google Play Store and [download Clave](http://getclave.io/download?ref=blog2.getclave.io).
