The transactions in ClaveSDK are in type of `PopulatedTransaction`, which implements custom interface of `IPopulatedTransaction`.
This means that all the methods, which aims to change the state of the blockchain, will return a `PopulatedTransaction` object.


You can get the example populated transaction like below:


```ts

/**
* @param to To address
* @param value Value to send - Defaults is BigNumber.from(0)
* @param data Data to send - Defaults to '0x'
 */
const populatedTransaction = claveSDK.genPopulatedTransaction("PUBLIC_ADDRESS", BigNumber.from(0), "0x")
```

You can use `send` method of `populatedTransaction` object to send the transaction to the blockchain.

```ts
/**
 * @param validatorAddress - Optional. The validator address, defaults to a constant address. - Defaults to P256 validator
 * @param hookData - Optional. Additional data for hooks, defaults to an empty array.
 */
const tx = await populatedTransaction.send("0xVALIDATOR_ADDRESS", [])
```
