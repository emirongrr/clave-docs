We aim to onboard users to Clave Wallet in the most seamless way possible. We get rid of seed-phrases and private keys on onboarding. You are expected to have an `email` and set `username` in onboarding process.

### Why do we need email?

Although you are able to onboard yourself to the Clave Wallet without and email on Smart Contract level,
we need to have an email to be able to send you notifications and to be able to notify you about emergency situations,
such as unexpected recovery of your account. We believe that this is a crucial part of the user experience.

Additionally, we need an email to be able to block users spamming the username taking process. Since the usernames are
unique and defines your identity, we need to make sure that no one is able to take all usernames with simple scripting.
