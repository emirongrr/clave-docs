# Apple Users

Here is how Apple users can sign up with passkeys:

### [iCloud Keychain](./icloud-keychain)
Apple devices have a native password manager named iCloud Keychain. It has the best security practices and comes default with all Apple Devices. So, if you don't know which password manager you're using, you can use iCloud Keychain natively.
### [1Password](./1password)
1password is a popular password manager that works on Apple and Android devices.
