### Clave’s Mission

In the evolving world of cryptocurrencies, it has become imperative to bridge the gap between the technical complexity of the blockchain world and the everyday user. This is precisely the challenge that Clave has embraced. Our mission? To make blockchains accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

### Building a Wallet - Making Crypto Accessible for Everyone

The decentralized web, commonly referred to as Web3, represents a new era of online interactions. But as with any significant technological evolution, it comes with challenges. Current Web3 interfaces are often not user-centric, leaving many feeling alienated with high gas fees, complex DApp interactions, and a steep learning curve (for key management and security). Moreover, existing wallets tend to prioritize function over user experience, making the journey into crypto discouraging for many.

We're building the Clave wallet as a response to this need - a beacon in the occasionally foggy landscape of Web3. Our wallet is not just an application; it's a statement, asserting that cryptocurrency and blockchain should and can be accessible to everyone, irrespective of their technical background.

Our approach to building the Clave wallet has been defined by two core principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Crypto shouldn't be a members-only club. Design and usability are at the forefront of our objectives. We believe that for crypto to truly be for everyone, the barriers to entry need to be minimized. This means a clean, intuitive user interface, simplified processes, and a wallet that speaks the language of the user.

2. **Security**: In the world of digital assets, the importance of security cannot be stressed enough. While we aim for simplicity, it does not come at the cost of compromising on security. Our wallet ensures that users’ assets are protected at all times.

### Clave’s Offerings

To achieve our mission, we’ve tailored our offerings to focus on aspects that we believe are the most critical for a user-friendly crypto experience.

#### Easy, One Click Onboarding - Secure Key Management

Entering the world of crypto is often a hard journey for users. Grasping the significance of a 12-word mnemonic phrase, figuring out a safe method to preserve it, and understanding the intricacies of funding their wallet all present steep learning curves for newcomers. However, starting with Clave is a breeze. Our onboarding process is smooth, guiding new users step by step. And when it comes to the most crucial aspect - key management. We leverage the Secure Enclave for key management, but what does this mean?

The Secure Enclave is a separate microchip embedded within users' everyday devices. It is isolated from the main components of their phones and can be accessed via biometric authentication. The Secure Enclave is designed to protect users' sensitive data from other parts of the phone. By using this separate microchip for key management, standard devices effectively achieve a level of security that closely mirrors that of hardware wallets.

#### Human Readable Transactions

Gone are the days of confusing strings of numbers and letters that make little sense to the average user. With Clave, transactions are displayed in a 'human-readable' format, ensuring you always know the details of your transactions without the need for jargon or complex codes.

We recognize the fear that comes with the thought of losing access to one’s digital assets. With Clave’s unique recoverability features, regaining access to your assets is straightforward without compromising security. We are offering different recovery options for all users’ segments.

#### Sponsored Transactions

In an effort to further enhance the user experience, Clave introduces the concept of sponsored transactions. This feature allows users to perform transactions without worrying about the nitty-gritty of fees, making the process smoother and more user-friendly. We're also eliminating the requirement to hold Ether (or any native token) to cover transaction fees; users are going to be able to pay fees in any ERC20 token that they wish.
